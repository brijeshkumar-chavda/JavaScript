// Topic: Property Access

// Q. What is Property Access?
// -> It is use to access character from string like we are accessing element from array.

// Note:
// -> It's look like we are accessing element from array but it's not.
// -> If no character is found [] return undefine.
// -> It's read only you can't add character in string like we do in array str[0] = A (This won't give you the error but it will not work.)

// Syntax:
// string[indexNumber]

let variable = "Hello world";
console.log(variable[3]);
