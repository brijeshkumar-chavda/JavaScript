### What

Context in programming refers to the environment or circumstances in which a piece of code operates. It encompasses the surrounding information, data, and conditions that influence the code's behavior.

### Why

Understanding context is crucial for:

- Debugging issues
- Code optimization
- Security
- Code maintainability

### How

Context is established through:

- Global variables
- Function arguments
- Object properties
- Database connections
- User interface elements
- Execution environment

### Example

Imagine a function that calculates a user's total income. The context for this function would include:

- The user's income data
- Tax rates
- Deduction rules

### Important Note

Context can vary depending on the programming language, framework, and application. It's essential to consider the context when writing and understanding code.

### Analogy

Context is like the stage on which a play unfolds. The actors (code) perform their roles based on the setting, props, and other characters (data and environment).
