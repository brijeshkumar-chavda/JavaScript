# Asynchronous Operation

What

- An asynchronous operation is a process that starts but doesn't necessarily finish immediately.
- It allows a program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the operation to complete.

Why

- Improved Performance: Prevents the program from freezing while waiting for long-running tasks.
- Better User Experience: Maintains responsiveness and allows users to interact with the application while background tasks are in progress.
- Efficient Resource Utilization: Enables handling multiple tasks concurrently.

How

- When an asynchronous operation starts, it runs in the background. The program can continue executing other code while the operation is in progress.
- Once the operation completes, a callback function or a promise is used to handle the result.

Example

- Fetching data from a server is a common asynchronous operation.
- The code can continue executing other tasks while waiting for the data to be retrieved.
- Once the data is available, a callback function is called to process it.

Note

- Asynchronous programming can introduce complexities like callbacks, promises, or async/await. Careful handling is required to manage asynchronous code effectively.

When

- Use asynchronous operations for tasks that are time-consuming or might block the program's execution, such as network requests, file I/O, or database operations.
