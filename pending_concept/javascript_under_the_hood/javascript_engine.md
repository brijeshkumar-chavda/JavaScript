# JavaScript Engine

What

- A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. It's the core part of a JavaScript runtime environment.

Why

- Interprets JavaScript: Translates human-readable JavaScript code into machine-understandable instructions.
- Optimizes performance: Employs techniques like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to improve execution speed.
- Manages memory: Handles memory allocation and garbage collection.

How

- Parsing: Breaks down JavaScript code into smaller parts (tokens).
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): Creates a tree-like structure representing the code's structure.
- Interpretation or Compilation: Executes code directly or compiles it into machine code.
- Execution: Runs the compiled code or interpreted instructions.

Example

- V8: Used in Google Chrome and Node.js.
- SpiderMonkey: Used in Mozilla Firefox.
- JavaScriptCore: Used in Safari.

Note

- Modern JavaScript engines often use a combination of interpretation and compilation for optimal performance. They also include features like garbage collection to manage memory efficiently.

Analogy

- Think of a JavaScript engine as a translator that converts English (JavaScript) into a language the computer understands (machine code).
