Runtime

What
- Runtime refers to the period during which a computer program is executing. It's the time when the code is being processed and instructions are carried out.

### Why
Understanding runtime is crucial for:
* **Performance optimization:** Identifying bottlenecks and optimizing code for efficiency.
* **Debugging:** Pinpointing errors or unexpected behavior.
* **Resource management:** Managing memory usage and other system resources effectively.

### How
The runtime environment provides the context and resources necessary for code execution. It includes:
* **Memory management:** Allocating and deallocating memory for variables and data structures.
* **Garbage collection:** Automatically reclaiming unused memory.
* **Error handling:** Handling exceptions and errors that occur during execution.
* **Interacting with the operating system:** Accessing system resources and performing I/O operations.

### Example
When you run a JavaScript program in a browser, the browser's JavaScript engine provides the runtime environment. The code is executed within this environment, accessing DOM elements, making network requests, and handling user interactions.

### Important Note
The runtime behavior of a program can be influenced by factors such as the hardware, operating system, and specific implementation details of the programming language or runtime environment.

### Analogy
Think of the runtime as the stage where a play is performed. The actors (the code) interact with the props (system resources), the audience (user input), and the overall setting (the runtime environment) to bring the story to life.
