// Topic: Shift() Method

// Q. What is shift() method?
// -> The shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that element. It also shifts all remaining elements one position towards the front of the array, effectively reducing the length of the array by 1.

// Example:
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Removing the first element and printing it
console.log(array.shift());

// Printing the modified array
console.log(array);
