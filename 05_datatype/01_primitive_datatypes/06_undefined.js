// `undefined`

// Resource

// What
// -> Undefined is a data type in JavaScript that represents a variable that has not been assigned a value.

// Why
// -> Undefined helps ensure that your program behaves correctly and handles different types of data appropriately.
// -> It provides a foundation for writing robust and maintainable code.

// How
// -> You can assign literally a value as undefined to a variable.
// -> Declared variables without assigning any value also have an undefined value.

// Syntax
let variableName1; // variable declared but not assigned any value
let variableName2 = undefined; // variable assigned the value `undefined`

// Note
// -> It is not recommended to explicitly assign the value undefined to a variable.
