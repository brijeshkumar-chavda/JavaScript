// Type Of Datatype

// What
// - Data types in JavaScript are the different types of values that can be stored and manipulated in a program.
// - They define the kind of data that a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on that data.

// Why
// - Data types help ensure that your program behaves correctly and handles different types of data appropriately.
// - They provide a foundation for writing robust and maintainable code.

// How
// - JavaScript has a set of built-in data types that define the kind of values that can be stored and manipulated in a program. These data types include:
// - Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
// - String: Represents textual data, enclosed in quotes.
// - Boolean: Represents logical values, which can be either true or false.
// - Object: Represents complex data structures, such as arrays, functions, and custom objects.
// - Undefined: Represents a variable that has not been assigned a value.
// - Null: Represents a variable that has been explicitly assigned a value of null.

// Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference, Complex)

// Object
const object = {
  key1: "value1",
  key2: "value2",
  key3: "value3",
};

// Array
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Function
function myFunction(parameter) {
  return parameter;
}
