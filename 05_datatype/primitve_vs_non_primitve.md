# What Are The Primitive & Non-Primitive Datatype?

1. Primitive Data Types:

   - **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
   - **String**: Represents sequences of characters, such as text.
   - **Boolean**: Represents true or false values.
   - **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value.
   - **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any value.
   - **Symbol**: Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), symbols are unique and immutable values that are often used as object property keys.

2. Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference, Complex):
   - **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be of any data type.
   - **Array**: Represents an ordered list of values, indexed by integers.
   - **Function**: Represents executable code that can be invoked or called.

## Note

- Primitive data types are passed by value
- Non-Primitive data types (objects, arrays, functions) are passed by reference. 
- This distinction can have implications for how values are copied and shared between variables.
